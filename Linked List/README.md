#### Remember these points while solving Linked List questions:
- Any function that can change the first element of a linked list must be passed a *pointer* to the *head pointer*.
- Always test for the end of a Linked List as you traverse it.
- The *Runner* technique: Iterating Linked List with two pointers simultaneously. The *fast* node may be ahead by a fixed amount, or it might be hopping multiple nodes for each one node that *slow* node iterates through.
- A number of Linked List problems rely on recursion.
